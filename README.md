# Handling Exceptions in ASP.NET Core Web API with IExceptionHandler

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and explanations for implementing a centralized exception handling system in ASP.NET Core Web API using IExceptionHandler. The project demonstrates how to create a robust error management solution that can improve the reliability and maintainability of your application.

## Note

This repository accompanies an article written in Italian. The code comments and variable names are in English, but the full explanation and tutorial are available in Italian on the blog post linked below.

## Key Features

### Centralized exception handling with IExceptionHandler
Custom GlobalExceptionHandler implementation
Structured error responses using ProblemDetails
Configuration in Program.cs for seamless integration
Example of multiple exception handlers

## Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2022 or later
.NET 7.0 SDK or later
Basic knowledge of ASP.NET Core Web API

## Getting Started

Clone this repository
Open the solution in Visual Studio
Build and run the project
Use Swagger UI or a tool like Postman to test the error handling endpoints

## Project Structure

Handlers/GlobalExceptionHandler.cs: Contains the main implementation of IExceptionHandler
Program.cs: Shows how to configure and use the exception handler
Controllers/TestController.cs: Includes endpoints to simulate different types of exceptions

## Usage
The GlobalExceptionHandler class can be customized to handle different types of exceptions according to your needs. The handler is registered in Program.cs and will automatically catch and process unhandled exceptions throughout your application.

## Advanced Topics

Multiple exception handlers
Customizing error responses for different exception types
Logging and monitoring considerations
